## 问题描述
[Climbing Stairs](https://leetcode.com/problems/climbing-stairs/ )：
You are climbing a stair case. It takes n steps to reach to the top.

Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

Note: Given n will be a positive integer.

## 解题思路
* 动态规划。用一个tmp保存[:n]的数值，然后计算[n-2]+[n-1]

## 代码
```python
def climbStairs(self, n: int) -> int:
    if n<=2:
        return n
    tmp = [0 for i in range(n+1)]
    tmp[1] = 1
    tmp[2] = 2
    for i in range(3,n+1):
        tmp[i]=tmp[i-1]+tmp[i-2]
    return tmp[n]

```

## 其他思路
- 不用把历史都存下来
```python
    def climbStairs(self, n: int) -> int:
        if n < 3: return n
        oneback = twoback = 1
        for i in range(2, n):
            oneback, twoback = oneback + twoback, oneback
        return oneback + twoback
```
